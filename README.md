# 🤖 AI vs Human Text Classifier (Traditional ML Approach)

This project demonstrates a simple and explainable machine learning approach to detect whether a given text is written by a human or generated by an AI. It uses natural language preprocessing, feature engineering, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Random Forest classifier for prediction.

---

## 📌 Overview

The rise of language models like ChatGPT has made it important to distinguish AI-generated content from human writing. This project shows how to build a traditional machine learning pipeline to classify text as AI or human-authored using a small custom dataset and scikit-learn.

---

## 📁 Dataset

A custom mini dataset with labeled samples for both AI and human text is used. Examples include:

* Human: “Humans write in fragmented ways with emotion.”
* AI: “AI-generated outputs are grammatically clean.”

Each example is labeled as `"human"` or `"ai"` and used to train the model.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 🔧 Requirements

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas nltk textstat scikit-learn
```

Then download NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download("punkt")
nltk.download("stopwords")
```

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Text Cleaning**

   * Convert to lowercase
   * Tokenize
   * Remove stopwords and non-alphanumeric tokens

2. **Feature Engineering**

   * Word count
   * Character count
   * Lexical diversity
   * Flesch Reading Ease score

3. **Text Vectorization**

   * TF-IDF with unigrams and bigrams

4. **Model Training**

   * Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn

5. **Prediction Function**

   * `classify_text(text)` returns `"AI-Generated"` or `"Human-Written"`

## 🧠 Techniques Used

* **NLTK** for tokenization and stopword removal
* **TextStat** for readability scoring
* **TF-IDF Vectorization** with n-grams
* **Random Forest Classifier** from scikit-learn
* **Feature engineering**: counts, lexical diversity, readability

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Train on larger real-world datasets (e.g., HC3, GPT-4 data)
* Add web UI with Streamlit or Flask
* Compare with transformer-based models (RoBERTa, DistilBERT)
